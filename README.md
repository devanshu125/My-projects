# My-projects
Includes few projects I worked on
The file C++_project includes a project which I made during High School. It's based on the concept of Data File Handling. Its a course manager for University where you can enter the courses you take in a semester by entering course name, number, etc. Also it can search for a course by the course number entered, it also allows the user to modify the details entered and delete the details entered.
